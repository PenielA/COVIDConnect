# COVIDConnect

## About our application
COVID-19 has caused economic and social strain on our communities.
Many have been left without necessities such as food, housing, and a flow of income.
Our application seeks to reconnect our communities and help those in need while building
relationships between people. COVIDConnect allows people in need of help to ask for assistance
and allows people who can offer up help opportunities to help those who need it. Our application
is a platform that gives more voice to our community members so that we can reconnect during this disconnect.
